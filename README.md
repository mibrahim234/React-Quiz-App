## Description 
React Millionaire is an interactive web application built using React. 
React Millionaire is an application which tests users on their knowledge of React. <br>I was inspired to make this app from the actual game "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire". <br> The game is simple. The user will receive money after each question they answer. If you answer all the questions correctly you win $1,000,000. User will select an answer and wait three seconds before getting their result. Green indicates correct while red indicates incorrect.<br>  If the user answers incorrectly, the game will end and the amount the user earned will be displayed. <br> Have fun!<br> <br>
